This module provides DataObjects for sections in the
[`syntro/recipe-elemental-bootstrap`](https://github.com/syntro-opensource/recipe-elemental-bootstrap) recipe and other, standalone modules.

It adds an extension to the base element, which anables handling color management
for bootstrap blocks and uses a different controller template, suitable for
full-width bootstrap based themes. An additional data object is provided as a
base sub-element of a section, handling permissions and publishing.
